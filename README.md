# watado-mobile
This is the mobile version of Watado using the Ionic framework

Watado is a mobile app that let's people in Lagos have a sense of what's going on at their favourite social spots in real-time. 
Visitors who are at a place can drop pins at their current location to signify that they are there (their names won't be shown to other viewers).

Viewers can seee a heatmap of the number of people clustered at various places in real-time.
Once a user leaves a specific km radius of a location, their pin is automatically deleted, and the cluster size/number reduces
